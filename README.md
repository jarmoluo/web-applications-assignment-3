## Assignment 1

Introduction

The theme of this week is getting familiar with HTML, the basics of JavaScript, and how these two connect to each other in the browser. In order to practice our skills on those themes, we will create a simple tic tac toe game and an attached JavaScript system to manipulate and score the gaming grid.

In the assignment, we will also familiarize ourselves with the Codesandbox programming environment, which is a convenient browser-based HTML+JavaScript programming and preview environment.

Requirements and scoring

1. Create a tic tac toe table using HTML

- Create a basic HTML markup with the empty container with ID “board”

2. Create a data structure using JavaScript

- Render the empty 5x5 table with JavaScript

3. Make the table interactive

- On every click, table cell should be filled with either ‘x’ or ‘o’ depending on the current player

4. Create a function to calculate the win condition

- If one player has 5 symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, the program should call Alert with the text “Player N won!”, where N should be 1 or 2 respectively.

5. Bonus: Make the table infinite - the board should always have 3 empty rows and columns on each side.
